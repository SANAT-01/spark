We have solve this problem using Spark and graphframes and also tried to 
implement this in jupyter notebook for a small dataset data2.txt to check the 
correctness of the code.

Output in jupyter - it shows some nested tuples where the first element represent 
	 the node , second element as its shortest min distance and the 
 	 the third element as its path from the source the current node
	 considering the distance between two nodes as 1.
